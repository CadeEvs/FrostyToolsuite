## Development
This is a rewrite of the FrostyToolsuite in .NET 7, which is in very early development.

It aims to clean up the code base and use [Avalonia UI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) with The [MVVM Community Toolkit](https://aka.ms/mvvmtoolkit/docs) instead of WPF.
Another reason for the rewrite is to completely seperated the 2 core libraries FrostySdk and FrostyModSupport from the ModManager and Editor.
