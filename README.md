# FrostyToolsuite
The most advanced modding platform for games running on DICE's Frostbite game engine.

## Setup

1. Download Git https://git-scm.com/download/win.
2. Create an empty folder, go inside it, right click an empty space and hit "Git Bash Here". That should open up a command prompt.
3. Press the green "Code" button in the repository and copy the text under "HTTPS".
4. Type out ``git clone -b <branch_name> <HTTPS code>`` in the command prompt and hit enter. This should clone the project files into the folder.
5. Open the solution (found under FrostyEditor) with **Visual Studio 2019**, and make sure the project is set to ``DeveloperDebug`` and ``x64``. Close out of retarget window if prompted.
6. Only build the projects themselves, never the solution.
